OpenChallenge

OpenChallenge is a new app that allows you to challenge your friends in anything that comes to your mind.

The focus is on people meeting in a place to take part in challenges: here people are not passive and can put themselves to the test or just have fun with close friends.

Pubs are an important part of the atmosphere and are especially encouraged to organize challenges in order to increase the number of clients of their activities!
